Welcome to Configuration Interaction's documentation!
=====================================================

This project implements the configuration interaction method for arbitrary
truncation levels. Included are the time-indepedent configuration interaction
methods for ground state computations, and the time-dependent formulation
allowing for arbitrary time-dependent electronic systems.
See quantum-systems_ for the setup of various many-body systems.
